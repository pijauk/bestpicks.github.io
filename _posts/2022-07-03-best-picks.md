Our top honor goes to the SteelSeries Rival 5 for being impressively capable and stunningly affordable. This pick doesn’t leave much else to be desired with its $60 price point and versatility. Impressively, SteelSeries actually increased the number of buttons available on the Rival 5 over those found on the Rival 600. You get your usual assortment, plus a third thumb button situated near the front of the mouse as well as a two-way, flickable button above the Back and Forward buttons. This makes it a great combo of an average gaming mouse and MMO or MOBA option.

The SteelSeries Rival 5 follows the trend of gaming mice shedding weight, as it’s slightly cut back from the Rival 600. Part of that weight loss may come from the omission of a depth sensor, but the Rival 5’s TrueMove Air optical sensor still provides solid tracking. Being a wired option also helps contribute to its lightweight. An added perk is the considerable RGB lighting on board with a zone at the scroll wheel, a zone in the SteelSeries logo on the palm rest, and two RGB strips on each side of the palm rest each with four independent lighting zones.
