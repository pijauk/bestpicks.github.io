Our top honor goes to the [SteelSeries Rival 5](https://amzn.to/3RaqFJp) for being impressively capable and stunningly affordable. This pick doesnâ€™t leave much else to be desired with its $60 price point and versatility. Impressively, SteelSeries actually increased the number of buttons available on the Rival 5 over those found on the Rival 600. You get your usual assortment, plus a third thumb button situated near the front of the mouse as well as a two-way, flickable button above the Back and Forward buttons. This makes it a great combo of an average gaming mouse and MMO or MOBA option.
