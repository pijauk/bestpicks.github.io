Sensor: TrueMove Air optical | Sensitivity: 18,000 CPI | Shape: Right-Handed | Buttons: 9 | Connection: Wired | Weight: 85g

> Our top honor goes to the [SteelSeries Rival 5](https://amzn.to/3RaqFJp) for being impressively capable and stunningly affordable. This pick doesn’t leave much else to be desired with its $60 price point and versatility. Impressively, SteelSeries actually increased the number of buttons available on the Rival 5 over those found on the Rival 600. You get your usual assortment, plus a third thumb button situated near the front of the mouse as well as a two-way, flickable button above the Back and Forward buttons. This makes it a great combo of an average gaming mouse and MMO or MOBA option.

So, what do you miss out on by going with the wireless mouse? More or less nothing. It uses 2.4GHz Slipstream Wireless connectivity to keep a strong, low-latency link between itself and your computer, so you should get the same response times your wired competitors get.

> The Logitech G502 Lightspeed leans toward the more expensive side of the market at $150, but you won't find a better ergonomically designed wireless gaming mouse. It really throws in every single wireless technology Logitech has developed including its "Lightspeed" wireless connection and Powerplay wireless charging. And there is no need to worry about latency, this mouse is speedy and accurate. Plus, it offers pretty much perfect tracking from 100 DPI to 16,000 DPI, not that you'll ever even need to go that high.

This gaming mouse takes the great shape and handy DPI clutch of the original and adds wireless technology along with Razer's fastest sensor and optical switches for the speediest gaming mouse you've ever used. It boasts 20,000 DPI, 650 IPS max speed, and 50G acceleration plus there are 11 programable buttons. This is a fully loaded gaming mouse.

# 5. Razer Viper Mini

> _Best Small Gaming Mouse_

### [View Amazon Price](https://amzn.to/3AurwyJ) | [Buy](https://amzn.to/3AurwyJ)

<img src="https://kainos-img.dgn.lt/photos2_25_65250481/img.jpg" alt="Razer Viper Mini" height="200"/>

Sensor: Optical | Sensitivity: 8,500 CPI | Shape: Ambi-dextrous | Buttons: 6 | Connection: Wired | Weight: 61g

> If you don't have the biggest hands or just don't like the extra bulk of some gaming mice, Razer has a solution. The Razer Viper Mini takes the design of the stylish Viper and shrinks it down a bit while also cutting the weight. It's actually the lightest mouse Razer offers. This model is slightly taller than the original, but it trims the length and width to give smaller hands an easier grip and access to the main buttons without needing to awkwardly slide forward.
